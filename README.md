# Project title
Reverse Engineering to Estimate Subsurface Utility Infrastructure Density for Financing Smart City Infrastructure

### Project description
This capstone will develop a methodology to estimate subsurface utility infrastructure density (3D volumetric approach) within NYC from NYC DCP surface density maps, USGS Lidar, and NYC DOT street geometry data for public right of way area calculations (and possibly estimating subsurface densities in Westchester and Nassau Counties for comparison purposes in a similar manner), to permit a subsequent estimation of a utility pricing gap within NYC to support development of revenue sources to finance utilidors.

Subsurface excel: This is the data obtained from the final processing of LION.

### Final deliverables in ArcGIS Pro
The final subsurface density map is accessed by ArcGIS Pro and the final deliverables are stored in file type ppkx in ArcGIS Pro.
